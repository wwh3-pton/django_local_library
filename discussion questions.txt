5) There are definitely plenty of different JavaScript functions that could be used to improve the functionality of HandyRides. For example, one could probably create a function that creates a map displaying the different people's locations, allowing people to get more of a visual answer to their search inquiry. You could also probably use JavaScript to create a function that could take your search inquiry, come up with a list of locations similar to the one you searched for, and search for those terms as well. This could be very beneficial, especially if you're going somewhere not particularly popular; perhaps no one is going exactly where you are, but there may be people going somewhere very close to where you want to go, and this function could show you those people.

6) The main advantage of saving state information on the client is that it means there's less work for the server to do, so it streamlines the overall processing of the website, since all of that information doesn't need to be handled by the server. There are, however, two main drawbacks to such methodolgy. For one, there is a (minor) security risk, as the information stored on the client is almost certainly less secure than if it were on the server, so you wouldn't want to use the client to store more valuable information. Also, the information is more likely to be lost (i.e., by someone clearing their cookies) or going unused (someone using a different browser), so if the information is something that's needed, it's less likely to be maintained on the client than if it were on the server.
